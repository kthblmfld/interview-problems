# hacker-rank-problems

I am using this project to debug problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) as they tend to go off the rails in the more advanced test cases (leaving little clue as to _why_ they went south).
 
Having them here allows me to revert historical changes and dig deep. Even though I still sometimes end up peeking at the final answer in the discussion room, tinkering with the problem here first helps me comprehend and realize the value of the final answer.

Also, having them here makes it easier to organize problems solved vs. problems in progress ( x out of n tests currently passing ). 

The problem classes are modified when necessary to print their results to System.out.
